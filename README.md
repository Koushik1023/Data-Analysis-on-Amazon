# Data-Analysis-on-Amazon
This project automates scraping sponsored product data from Amazon.in based on user input search queries. It extracts key product details such as title, brand, price, rating, number of reviews, product URLs, and images. The scraped data is saved as a CSV file for further analysis. The project also includes data cleaning steps to normalize and prepare the data for insights, such as removing duplicates and converting price and rating values into consistent numeric formats.
With the cleaned data, the project provides several analyses: identifying top brands by frequency and average rating, examining the distribution of reviews and ratings to highlight popular and highly rated products, and exploring price versus rating trends to discover affordable high-value products as well as overpriced low-rated ones. Visualizations such as bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots help convey these insights clearly.
